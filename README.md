# HTL Biocrude Prediction Model
This script is part of a university research initiative to predict the bio-oil yield of Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL).

HTL is a biochemical process that converts biowaste into crude-like oil in an environmentally-friendly manner. The ability to predict bio-oil yield from HTL enables accurate estimation of life-cycle analysis and techno-economic assessment. 

The code was developed under the guidance of [Ali Ahmad](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BPuda6sAAAAJ&hl=en) and in collaboration with Kevin Warren.
